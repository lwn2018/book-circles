# PagePass App Store Assets Brief

## Overview

We're converting the PagePass web app into native iOS and Android apps using Capacitor. This document outlines all graphic assets needed for Apple App Store and Google Play Store submissions.

---

## App Icon

The app icon is the most important visual asset — it appears everywhere (store listing, home screen, notifications).

### Requirements

| Platform | Size | Format | Notes |
|----------|------|--------|-------|
| Apple App Store | 1024×1024 px | PNG | No transparency, no rounded corners (Apple adds them automatically) |
| Google Play | 512×512 px | PNG | Can have transparency |

### Deliverables

- 1× master icon file at 1024×1024 px
- Export at 512×512 px for Google Play
- Apple will auto-generate all other sizes from the 1024px version

### Design Notes

- Should be recognizable at small sizes (avoid fine details)
- PagePass brand: books, sharing, community
- Consider how it looks on both light and dark backgrounds

---

## Google Play Feature Graphic

**Required for Google Play Store**

| Size | Format |
|------|--------|
| 1024×500 px | PNG or JPG |

This is the large banner displayed at the top of the Play Store listing. It's prime real estate for communicating what the app does.

### Design Notes

- Include app name/logo
- Brief tagline or value proposition
- Visually compelling — this is the first thing users see
- Avoid putting critical info at edges (may be cropped on some devices)

## Screenshots

Screenshots show the app in action and are critical for conversion. Users scroll through these to decide whether to download.

|--------|------------|----------|
| iPhone 6.7" (iPhone 14/15 Pro Max) | 1290×2796 px | 3-10 required |
| iPhone 6.5" (iPhone 11 Pro Max/XS Max) | 1284×2778 px | 3-10 required |

| 7" Tablet (optional) | 1080×1920 px | 1-8 |
| 10" Tablet (optional) | 1920×1200 px | 1-8 |

### Recommended Screenshot Screens

Create 6-8 screenshots showing these key features:

1. **Welcome/Onboarding** — First impression, brand feel
2. **Circles View** — Show the social/community aspect
3. **Book Shelf** — Personal library view
4. **Book Detail** — Individual book with borrow option
5. **Handoff Flow** — The magic moment of sharing a book
6. **Add Book** — Easy to add books (ISBN scan, search)
7. **Profile/Settings** — Personalization options
8. **Notifications** — Stay connected with your circles

### Screenshot Design Notes

- Can include device frames (phone mockup) or go frameless
- Add text captions highlighting features (e.g., "Share books with friends")
- Keep text minimal and large enough to read
- Show real content, not placeholder data
- Maintain consistent style across all screenshots

---

## Optional: Promotional Video

Both stores support video previews. Not required but highly recommended.

### Apple App Store

- 15-30 seconds
- Same dimensions as screenshots
- Shows app in use (screen recording with optional overlays)
- No audio required (most users browse with sound off)

### Google Play

- YouTube video link
- Landscape orientation recommended
- Can be longer (30-60 seconds typical)

### Video Content Ideas

- Quick tour of creating a circle and adding friends
- Adding a book to your shelf
- The handoff experience (giving/receiving a book)
- Discovering new books from your circles
